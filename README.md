<em> Abstract </em> â€” In this paper we study the problem of exploration of unknown environments. In particular, we approach this
problem using a Multi Agent System (MAS) in which each agent determines which location has to visit according to an
interest level assigned to the surrounding environment. Unlike other already existing similar works in this context, we adopt
a peer-to-peer architecture for our system, with the main goal of supplying a viable Multi Agent System capable of exploring
unknown environments with an high-fault tolerance level, as in unknown possible hostile environments, like war fields or
different planets, it is often impossible to repair agents if they break down. With our approach, should an agent cease
functioning, the others will continue to function normally and the exploration of the environment continues. We also hope
to achieve acceptable environment exploration times and low object classification error, achieving thus to obtain a model that
is efficient and appropriate for use in a real world exploration scenario
